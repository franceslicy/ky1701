inversion vs function
roman vs bass

chord to bass line
chord double root
e.g.

CEG 1 > 5 > 3

bass > root

**
V7 can be reduced to V -> root, third

major, minor same V7


write summary implement program write report 

I 64 (GCE) is similar with V 64(or even better!)

II(FAD) IV(FAC) II7(DFAC) are similar

Tonic: I VI
Subdominant: II IV
Dominant: V VII III

steps to find key
reduce scores to list of chords
match chords to music keys
try to find possible progression “path”
V7 -> I perfect cadence


========
save model

all front end parameters binary


most of time bass changes, bass -> chord

baseline -> roman number change

chord recognition
bar by bar
beat by beat
smaller

3 styles
1. user define parameter without neural network
2. select learnt style
3. do machine learning

single note -> single note (ambiguous)
Canon in D
single note is a chord

e.g.
C -> D -> C -> C
1. all combines into a chord
2. each note is chord

broken chord

(1) 1 note
to
(2) 2 note

C G D

1. merge with reason, 1st note is belong to 2nd notes
bg: C major
C -> GD
I -> V
4 notes -> 1 note
if the 1 note is much higher in pitch, bass line indicates a chord

bassline does not rest. baseline
(C)EGC -> G -> G -> G…
chord not change
(C)EGC -> D -> E -> F -> G
chord probably changes (has dissonance)
numerical
C IV53 (F)AC -> C II63 (F)AD
or
figured bass
C IV (F)AC -> C IV

summary
II65 DFAC

use canon to test harmony
statistic analysis of chord conflict and flow


Counts I V priority
I -> V -> V -> I
add pitch classes dynamically

seventh replace third, fifth

dissonance resolves by step
B -> C

pedal point
lowest note, irrelevant to the chord used

music key:
C maj: I VI G Major VI
C maj: I G major II V I
G maj: IV II V I

10 chords
D minor -> G major
7th and 8th are V and I
? ? ? ? ? ? V/G I/G ? ?
I/d minor ? ? ? ? ? V/G I/G ? ?

Then the 2nd chord to 6th chord somewhere there music theorist would identify a place called a pivot
pivot means the chord belongs to both d minor and G major

Two big categories
1. Secondary dominants not modulation
2. pivot then confirmation key change

Secondary dominants mean at any given time. The composer can write a V or VII of any key and resolve to that key.
VII I means diminished seventh
e.g. C chord -> V of F# minor -> F# minor
secondary dominant is not modulation and temporary
C -> V/F# -> F# -> V/Bb -> Bb
as long as it’s V or dim7 of a key and to that key
Modulation
Old key……..an area of possible pivots to new key……. cadence V to I in new key……..
Pivots is: C major x chord = G major y chord

computer to identify the latest or earliest pivot

Step 1
Find the cadence in the new key
Step 2
Keep backing up from the cadence to see where the pivot is
D D/G D D/G D/G D/G G G G G 
/ here means or
the 6th chord is the latest pivot chord
2nd chord as pivot not good
because 3rd is exclusive D minor

optional key input

================

I+ can only occur at the end
Picardy third

resolve consequent dissonances

append -1 0 +1 is like adding reverb

analyze left hand
save exact chords
analyze both hands

homophonic
left hand: homophonic texture

three or more notes ring in the same rhythm => analyze notes

e.g. a score with chords by chords




key signature -> put more weight on that key

V7 65 43 42 -> must be same key

todos
1. alternative way from acoustic lasting effect
2. Add key signature assumptions
3. remove transition II -> I
4. if dissonance cannot resolve in step/half step -> X dissonance and reconsider
5. less possible modulations
6. i+
7. seven chord inversion -> DF#AC F#  

reduction:
1. sample choice
2. abstract 


corrected pitch class = set(corrected pitch class) - dissonance
